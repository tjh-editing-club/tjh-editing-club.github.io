<h2>FAQ:</h2>

<h3>How do I import videos to Davinci Resolve?</h3>
<p><i>Just drag it in. You can also right click, Import Media, then select the video you want to import.
If you're importing a video from your phone, copy it to the desktop first so it's easier to find.</i></p>

<h3>How do I export (save to your computer) what I am working on in Davinci?</h3>
<p><i>On the bottom bar, there will be a button called "Deliver," with a rocket ship. Click that, then on the top, click "YouTube 1080P." Click "Add to render queue," then, finally, click "Render All."
If you don't want to export the video, and just save it for later, go to the top right, click File, and then click Save.</i></p>

<h3>How do I import videos from my phone?</h3>

<h4>For iPhones:</h4>

<p><i>Get a cable and plug in your phone to your computer. There will be a popup that says, "Trust this computer?" Click <b>trust</b>. Now, open file explorer. Click on "This PC" and click on "Apple iPhone". It will show Internal Storage, then DCIM. Right click and Sort by Name, Ascending. Find the last folder. Open that. Right click and Sort By Date Created, Descending. Your most recently recorded videos (or photos) will be at the top. Drag that to your desktop so you can easily import it later.</i></p>

<h4>For Android Phones:</h4>

This might be a little different depending on your Android smartphone, but here's a general tutorial.
<br>
<p><i>Get a cable and plug in your phone to your computer. Now, open file explorer. Click on "This PC". It will show your phone model, such as "Xperia Z3" or "Galaxy Note 7". Open that. Go to Camera, then DCIM. Right click and Sort By Date Created, Descending. Your most recently recorded videos (or photos) will be at the top. Drag that to the desktop so you can easily import it later.</i></p>
